## Face Detector

### A program that uses AI / Machine Learning to detect human faces in images

### User guide: 
Add the images that you wish to identify faces in to the images folder. The images can be of any size or format that you like. Note: This folder already contains some example images, feel free to remove these and try the program out with your own images. Then simply run the code and the images will appear, one by one, with each detected face surrounded by a green square.
